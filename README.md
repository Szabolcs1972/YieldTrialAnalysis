# YieldTrialAnalysis
Data analysis of plant yield trials

This software developed to assess the data of yield trials during the plant breeding process. You can save the results in remote database, or you can perform the summary statistics analysis.

The program is useful for plant breeders, yield trial managers and growers to see the performance of plant varieties (or hybrids) in their farms. The program can analyze data of trials with various number of varieties and replications.

You can load the data from MS-Excel .xlsx sheet. Set the size of the plots and the moisture level of the crop to adjust the yield for calculation (t/ha), then you can save the yield results in database to store for a long term. The other option is calculating the summary statistics.

The average yield, standard deviation (s), CV (s%) and performance by percentage of the average of checks is determined by the summary statistics. The results can be saved in MS-Excel file (Statistics.xlsx), where you can make charts based on the results.
